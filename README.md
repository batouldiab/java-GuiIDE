# java-GuiIDE - Java GUI Integrated Development Environment

Java-GuiIDE is a Java-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to visually create and manipulate graphical components. This project provides an intuitive way to design user interfaces and experiment with Java code without the need for extensive coding knowledge.

## Features

- **Visual Component Creation:** Easily create buttons, text fields, text boxes, and labels using a simple drag-and-drop interface.
- **Real-time Visualization:** See the changes in the GUI components in real-time as you modify and interact with them.
- **Code Export:** Export the generated GUI components as Java code, enabling users to incorporate them into their projects effortlessly.

## Dependencies
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
